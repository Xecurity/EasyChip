* Improve the app efficiency, e.g. HTTP requests are still performed within the main UI thread (for ease of programming… and I'm new to Android programming…)

* Retry when got HTTP connection errors

* Make the app also work when it is not open. Maybe use a notification or vibration.

* An option to ask for a passcode before confirming each payment

* Email verification for the backend server, and also solve the problem when multiple devices are using a same email address

* Alternative identities such as twitter accounts, other than only email addresses
